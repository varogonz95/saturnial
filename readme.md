## Installation.
To install **Saturnial**, you just need to have *NPM*.  
Run the command below in your favorite terminal and you are set!

	> npm install saturnial

This command will install all dependencies needed.  
See [requirements](./#requirements) for more information.

## Requirements.
Saturnial requires **Node v6.16** or higher to run.  

Although it is transpiled from *TypeScript* to *JavaScript*, it is **recomended** to write your applications with *TypeScript* and then transpile them to *.js* files.  

Saturnial makes use of [*Decorators*](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/decorators.html), as well as it exposes some Decorators too.  
So, when using Saturnial with TypeScript, make sure to enable *TSC* (TS Compiler) *Experimental Options* in your `tsconfing.json` file:
```json
{
  "experimentalDecorators": true,
  "emitDecoratorMetadata": true
}
```
But - **When should I use JavaScript?**  
Well, you *can* use Saturnial with JS, as long as you don't use *Decorators* (at least that you want to write them yourself) or any other TS feature unsupported by vanilla JS.
